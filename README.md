# iOS-Button-highlight-problem

Test this sample project on an actual iPhone device. Explanations are given inside the application.

I've discovered an issue where interface elements, say a UIToolbar with bar button items, don't give feedback to the user through highlighting when tapped. The issue exists in portrait mode and when the status bar is shown. It can't be reproduced on the iOS simulator.
